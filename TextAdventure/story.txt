DESCRIPTION: "Boss Battle - Oppression of Mariael \n Walking into the room at the top of the stairs you look across to a huge wooden desk, each leg carved in the shape of a sea serpent, just about visible. As you step forwards the dark room begins to light up. After taking a few steps you pause. Looking around you see that the entire room is surrounded by glass and water; that is, except for the North face which seemed to be made of bricks. As the blue lights shine through the water it creates the illusion that you are submerged in the ocean. Continuing to make your way through the room you begin to hear the broken muttering and rambling of... who is that? Someone you know? Pressing forwards you see that in a dark corner of the room, on a side with no glass, there is a figure with long plaited hair, shimmering green in the light. It does not seem like she has noticed you yet. You are convinced you remember her voice from somewhere."

DESCRIPTION: "Remembering that you slay dragons by removing their hearts you thrust your axe deep into the threads holding its heart in place. As the heart rolls onto the floor you are left with only minor burns on your hands. Watching intently it is as if you know what is going to happen. But as the body melts away into dust something occurs which you are sure never usually happens. Below the dust lies the limp body of the green haired woman, the place where her heart should have been left with only a gaping hole. Seeing the look upon her face you are struck with an even greater feeling of confusion. The mad look on her face had gone, and in its place sat a soft, contented smile. Walking back to the hooded woman you see a beautiful smile across her blood stained face, one that lit up the dark, damp room like the sun. Standing in awe your face falls as her face suddenly turns into a wicked smirk. Suddenly you realise that knelt next to her is the faceless woman. As the faceless woman shoots quickly over to you the hooded woman holds out her hand and blasts you with an unknown force against the wall. However, instead of crashing into the wall you are surprised when you fall onto a floor of stone and moss. Looking at your hand you realise that your armour has returned and you stand to find yourself back in the corridor. Turning to face the door you see that it now has a word scribbled on it; freedom."

DESCRIPTION: "Choosing to sacrifice yourself so that the woman would be given an opening to slay the serpent you close your eyes. Awaiting the pain you are surprised when instead you are wrapped in a warm embrace. You open your eyes to see that the woman has wrapped herself around you, using her body as a human shield against the blood she had spilled whilst beheading the serpent on her way past. You watch in shock and confusion as the acidic blood burns through her back. Not making a sound she only clings to you tighter, shielding you from every drop. As you hear the serpent hit the final floor, shaking the entire building, you try to switch places with the hooded woman, but she refuses to move. As you hit the floor you are cushioned by the body of the woman who violently vomits blood before looking over to the serpent. The scent of burning flesh that fills your nostrils almost causes you to vomit as you see the horrific burns on her body. Looking in the same direction as the hooded woman you see the exposed heart of the serpent, beating rapidly as blood spewed out of the surrounding sack. Its neck is also dangling from one flap of skin as it cackles madly, eyes rolling around in its head. As you approach the beast, its blood beginning to run dry, you have a strong feeling you have done this before. Stepping closer a weapon begins to materialize in your hand. Wielding the double handed axe you approach the serpent."

Using the serpent's body as leverage you manage to push yourself high enough to grasp the lamp. As the floor caves and the glass walls shatter you are thankful that this wall seems to hold. You watch with wide eyes as the serpent writhes in pain, toppling through floor after floor as the hooded woman throws herself from opposite walls, tearing at its scaly flesh. Her movements are so quick you struggle to follow them. Watching her you realise that her movement is so precise that she manages to escape every speck of acidic blood, even though it spurted relentlessly in every direction. Looking to your right you realise something is close to your face. So close that had it actually been able to breath you would have been able to feel its breath on your neck. Seeing a flash of skin you let go of the lamp, sending yourself tumbling down the floors towards the serpent. As you tumble closer to the serpent it unhinges its jaws, preparing to devour you."

You watch as the potion seems to have no effect on her skin. However, the woman suddenly bursts into a fit of disturbing yet sweet giggling. You watch as her body twists and snaps. You listen as her bones stretch and break. Before you is a huge sea serpent, struggling to fit its entire body into the room. Cackling madly it throws itself towards you, retracting two fangs from its mouth. However, before it reaches you it throws back its head, cackling madly as blood gushes from its neck. She stands before you just long enough to her wicked smile, before throwing herself around the room and slashing madly at the serpent.

Climbing out from under the desk you stand and watch as she stabs mercilessly at the heart of the green haired woman with twin daggers. The other woman laughs madly as she is stabbed and you watch in shock as she refuses die, blood splattering across the room and onto your face in the process. As your eyes shoot around the room you realise that the light is slowly becoming red as blood spurts in all directions, covering the glass.

Turning to again look up the staircase you watch as the woman swiftly jumps up the centre, bouncing from any wall she can reach. Blood pours down the centre of the stair way as she cuts off the limbs of the monsters. Confident she will take care of the rest of them you press on. As you run up the stairs, passing the broken bodies of monsters you realise something, something that would not pique the interest of an ordinary person, they would probably not even realise. The woman had cut into each of them specifically so they would not bleed on the stairs themselves, but instead the blood and loose limbs would fall down the centre. Looking upwards you can see that as the endless hoards of monsters run down she pulls each one close to the bannister before disposing of them. As you watch her you feel a strange sense of admiration as she delivers each blow perfectly, as though it was a performance she had practiced again and again. Lost in your own thoughts you reach the top of the staircase without even realising, only to find the woman has disappeared. "

You watch in awe, trying to follow her movements, but all you can see is the constant smirk that twists across her face as she effortlessly slays the monsters in the blink of an eye.

You try to retreat against the wall but with nowhere to go you find that all you can do to protect yourself is bring your legs tightly into your chest.

Throwing your body back against the wall you realise the entire room is padded.

Staring at the floor in deep contemplation you get the feeling someone is watching. In fact, you have had that feeling for some time now.

Falling to your knees as you grasp at your head the pain suddenly stops. Looking up you realise that the woman is gone, and in her place is a locket. Picking it up you realise it must be very old as it has rusted and feels like it could fall to pieces if you put any pressure on it. As you stare at the star shape you try to remember where you have seen it. However, you are broken out of your train of thought as you catch a glimpse of something from the corner of your eye. Lifting your eyes from the locket back to the window you see a woman falling towards the ground. Her brown scarf billows as she is sent flying past the window. Unable to make out her face under a brown hood you are, at least, able to make out a mess of blonde curls which tumble after her. As she flies past the window it is as if time suddenly slows down.
